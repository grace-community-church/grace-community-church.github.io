## Who We Are

Grace Community Church exists to glorify God by: holding to and sharing His Word, gathering with believers on Sunday morning and throughout the week and seeking His leading to reach His kingdom locally and beyond.  We believe in one God in three persons and that man is sinful by his nature and cannot come to God on his own. We believe these truths are taught through the Holy Bible and that Scripture is the inerrant and infallible Word of God. We hold that there is no other Scripture besides what is in the canon today and that “All Scripture is breathed out by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for training in righteousness”, 2 Timothy 3:16. This foundational principle is why we meet and gather together and without Scripture there would be no thread to knit us together. Although salvation means having a personal relationship with God, it is seen and proved through our lives lived out and our interactions with others.  We meet together to worship, pray, grow and play. We believe in real church for real people and seek to offer real worship, not a great performance, but a service with everyday brothers and sisters in Christ worshiping in heart and truth. That means we may sometimes be off key or misread something, but we desire congregation interaction during our worship. We seek to build real relationships that go deeper than Sunday morning smiles and handshakes. This goal is reached through small groups, church events and organized/unorganized gatherings.  As we worship, work and play together we become as a family seeking its Father’s will. We know that God can use one man to intercede or act in His behalf, but through the New Testament we also know that God wants us all to be a part of the one true body and to fellowship in a local church.  We believe we are to seek God’s kingdom and will and that we are to start locally and go to the ends of the earth with God’s truth.

## What to Expect on a Sunday Morning

We are a group of Christ centered believers that take our Faith seriously but we take ourselves with a grain of salt.  We are a family, not a professional organization.  This means you will find a casual atmosphere where people are welcome to come as they are–whether you like a suit and tie or blue jeans and a t-shirt, when you are at Grace you are welcome.  This also means that when you come you will not hear performers leading worship but brothers and sisters worshipping the Lord together.  Our goal on a Sunday morning is for passionate worship of our Lord and Savior and for real transparent community. Our unofficial motto is real church for real people, so come as you are with an expectation to meet with God and people just like you!

## History

Grace Community Church was an SBCV church plant and began its journey Easter of 2000.  Throughout the years God has been faithful to allow GCC to equip saints, make disciples, meet real needs and show and share the love of Jesus Christ to the greater Altavista area.  God has given GCC a home through the generous donation of a local businessman.  The old Altavista Elementary School became our meeting place in 2003 and has been a huge project and continues to be a huge project ever since.  With our short history we have been greatly blessed and look forward to what God is doing in this fellowship and this community.  We are excited about our history, but even more excited about our future, and would love for you to help us make history at GCC!
